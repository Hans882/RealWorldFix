# Real World Fix üèôÔ∏è

A smart civic engagement platform that empowers citizens to report everyday problems like potholes, garbage dumps, broken streetlights, and waterlogging. The platform leverages AI to intelligently cluster similar reports, community voting to prioritize issues, and automated digest reports to keep local government bodies and NGOs informed.

## üéØ Overview

CivicReport transforms how communities address civic problems by creating a transparent, data-driven approach to issue reporting and resolution. Citizens can easily report problems, vote on priorities, and track progress, while authorities receive organized, actionable insights through automated reports.
